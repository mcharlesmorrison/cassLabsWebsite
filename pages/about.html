            <p class="subText-heading"><b>Who are you guys?</b></p>
    
            <p>Cass Labs LLC is owned and operated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-m-084628a5/">Matt</a>. He worked in the bike industry as an engineer for several years before quitting to climb mountains full-time and eventually found Cass Labs. Matt is a UC Berkeley graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering, and enjoys building full-stack systems that integrate hardware and software. He also rides bikes, probably more than he works.</p>
    
            <p class="subText-heading"><b>What do you do?</b></p>
    
            <p>We offer engineering consulting services for the cycling and outdoor industry. We have built out an impressive data acquisition infrastructure that we use to help you design better product. We can also help you with backend engineering development.</p>
                
            <p class="subText-heading"><b>What does Cass Labs mean?</b></p>

            <p>Cass is short for <em>Cassandra</em>, a Greek mythological figure who warned people of inconvenient truths that were soon to bear out. People who failed to take heed suffered a terrible fate. I see the quantitative approach to engineering as much the same. Results often reveal things that run counter to our intuitions and biases. We should not ignore these sometimes inconvenient truths. That being said, we live in a world saturated with data yet starved for true understanding. Throwing a bunch of sensors on a bike and taking a &quot;big data&quot; approach is basically meaningless unless you do so with the intent of using the quantitative results to better understand the rider's subjective experience on the bike, which, at the end of the day, is what matters!</p>
