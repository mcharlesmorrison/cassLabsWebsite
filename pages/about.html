            <p><em>Who are you people?</em></p>
    
            <p>Cass Labs is owned and operated by Matt. He worked in the bike industry as an engineer for several years before quitting to embark on a vision quest deep in the deserts and high in the mountains of California. Upon his return to civilization, he made Cass Labs! He graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and enjoys to build full-stack systems that integrate hardware and software. He also rides bikes, probably more than he works.</p>
    
            <p><b>What does Cass Labs mean?</b></p>

            <p>Cass is short for <em>Cassandra</em>, a Greek mythological figure who warns people of inconvenient truths that are soon to bear out, people who failed to take heed suffered a terrible fate. I see the results of quantitative analysis much the same. Results often reveal things that run antithetical to our intuition or bias, and we should not ignore these sometimes inconvenient truth. That being said, we live in a world saturated with data yet starved for true understanding. Throwing a bunch of sensors on a bike and taking a "big data" approach is basically meaningless unless you do so with the intent of using the quantitative results to better understand the rider's subjective, or qualitative, experience on the bike, which at the end of the day is paramount! </p>
