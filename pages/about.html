            <p><b>Who are you people?</b></p>
    
            <p>Cass Labs is owned and operated by Matt. He worked in the bike industry as an engineer for several years before quitting to embark on a vision quest deep in the deserts and high in the mountains of California. Upon his return to civilization, he made Cass Labs. Matt is a UC Berkeley graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and enjoys building full-stack systems that integrate hardware and software. He also rides bikes, probably more than he works. Matt has lots of smart friends who help out, hopefully he will hire one soon.</p>
    
            <p><b>Who do you do?</b></p>
    
            <p>We offer engineering consulting services for the cycling industry (and the broader outdoor industry!). We have built out an impressive data acquisition insfrastructure that we use to help you design better product. Eventually, we will have a product offering, so hang tight. We can also help you with backend engineering development. Hit us up!</p>
    
            <p><b>What does Cass Labs mean?</b></p>

            <p>Cass is short for <em>Cassandra</em>, a Greek mythological figure who warned people of inconvenient truths that were soon to bear out. People who failed to take heed suffered a terrible fate. I see the quantitative approach to engineering much the same. Results often reveal things that run antithetical to our intuitions or biases, and we should not ignore these sometimes inconvenient truths. That being said, we live in a world saturated with data yet starved for true understanding. Throwing a bunch of sensors on a bike and taking a "big data" approach is basically meaningless unless you do so with the intent of using the quantitative results to better understand the rider's subjective, or qualitative, experience on the bike, which at the end of the day is what matters! </p>
